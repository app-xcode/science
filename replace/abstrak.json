The findings showed that teachers' TPACK skills, system quality, and service quality all positively affect OL success to differing degrees. This study's primary contribution is the novel integration of TPACK theory with the ISS Model, which other studies have not extensively investigated. Furthermore, this study highlights how critical it is to accommodate the unique needs and characteristics of students participating in online learning (OL). The results of this study can assist policymakers and educational practitioners in developing a more effective and efficient online learning environment that satisfies student demands and closes the theory-practice gap.</p></div>"}]}]}
